- **Testing:** Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes. Ensure all tests pass before making a pull request.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the repository to work on your changes.
2. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for the branch (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-typo`).
3. **Make Changes:** Implement your changes in the new branch. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
4. **Run Tests:** Ensure all tests pass and your code meets the project's standards.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your branch to your forked repository and submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.

### Review Process

- **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be prepared to make revisions based on feedback.
- **Approval:** Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

## Testing

To ensure the quality and reliability of the Chaise Talent project, it is important to run tests and add new tests as needed. Follow these instructions to run existing tests and add new ones:

### Running Tests

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd chaise-talent
   ```

2. **Run the test suite:**

   ```sh
   pnpm test
   ```

   This command will execute all the tests and display the results in the terminal.

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create a new test file:**
   Add your test file in the appropriate directory, typically under `tests` or `__tests__`.

2. **Write your tests:**
   Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write your tests. Ensure your tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.

   Example using Jest:

   ```js
   test("should return true when the value is positive", () => {
     const result = isPositive(5);
     expect(result).toBe(true);
   });
   ```

3. **Run your new tests:**

   ```sh
   pnpm test
   ```

   Verify that your new tests pass and do not break any existing functionality.

By following these steps, you can help maintain the integrity of the project and ensure that new features and bug fixes are properly tested.

## Deployment

To deploy the Chaise Talent project to different environments, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```sh
   docker build -t chaise-talent .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env chaise-talent
   ```

   This command will start the application in a Docker container and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

### Deployment to Production

For production deployment, consider using a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Here is a basic example using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

1. **Initialize Elastic Beanstalk:**

   ```sh
   eb init -p docker chaise-talent
   ```

2. **Create an environment:**

   ```sh
   eb create chaise-talent-env
   ```

3. **Deploy the application:**

   ```sh
   eb deploy
   ```

   This will deploy your Dockerized application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Continuous Deployment

For continuous deployment, integrate your repository with a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins. Here is an example using GitHub Actions:

1. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow file:**

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Production

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Docker Buildx
           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

         - name: Log in to Docker Hub
           uses: docker/login-action@v1
           with:
             username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
             password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

         - name: Build and push Docker image
           run: |
             docker build -t your-username/chaise-talent .
             docker push your-username/chaise-talent

         - name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
           run: |
             eb init -p docker chaise-talent
             eb create chaise-talent-env
